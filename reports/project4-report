Project 4 Report
=========================

Project 4 has two phases:
* Phase One: Incorporate IX support to RM layer
* Phase Two: Support relational operations
The operations implemented in this project:
    - Filter
    - Project
    - Grace Hash Join
    - Index Nested Loop Join
    - Basic Aggregate
Not implemented:
    - Block Nested Loop Join
    - Aggregate with GROUP BY

Testing Instruction
=========================
Since I do not implement BNLJoin and Aggragate (Group by version), clitest_08 and clitest_10
should fail in the middle. So please directly ignore those two tests. Or if any of the tests
crashes, please run ./cleanup.sh to delete any table files so that this failure cannot 
influence the results of the following tests.
